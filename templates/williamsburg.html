        <h2>
            Williamsburg is way different from areas like Bed Stuy because it is a gentrified community. It is made up of mostly white individuals and typically the buildings, the communities, and especially the cost is modern and high. With richer communities, it is no surprise that it is considered an outlier compared to the rest of Brooklyn. If you have the money to spend it on groceries, you might as well, which means that supermarkets are also going to be more keen in joining those communities if they want chance at making more profit.
        </h2>

        <h3>There is no solution here. Even though it is a gentrified space, its ratio is at 8, which is a great thing that we don't want to change. What we need to do is stop the increasing rents however, as lots of families cannot pay for quality food, let alone their rent. It couldn't hurt for the supermarkets, especially the companies to build more in other places.</h3>
